## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
Import icons as React-components.

::component-example
---
name: 'icon-import-example-react'
collapse: true
language: 'jsx'
---
::

### Generic Icon Component

Use the [B24Icon](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24icons/blob/main/packages/@bitrix24-icons-react/src/components/B24Icon.tsx) component for easy access to icons.

The component uses dynamic imports via `React.lazy()` to load icons as needed.

This does not break the `tree-shaking` principle because `tree-shaking` works with static imports, while dynamic imports
are used for load optimization, loading only the necessary parts of the code when they are needed.

> Specify the full icon name with the `name` prop, e.g., `Main::CopilotAiIcon`.
